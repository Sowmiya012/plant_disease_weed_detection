**🌱 Plant Disease Detection and Weed Localization**
This project integrates CNN, YOLOv5, and GAN models to create an automated system that detects plant diseases and localizes weeds using deep learning techniques. A Streamlit-based web application enables real-time and batch image analysis for end users like farmers, agronomists, and researchers.

🔍 **Features**
✅ Plant Disease Detection using a trained CNN model.

🎯 Weed Localization using YOLOv5 object detection.

🧠 Synthetic Image Generation with GAN for data augmentation.

📦 Batch Image Processing and visualization.

🌐 Streamlit Web App for easy deployment and usage.
